## My Mental Model: Serverless Computing
Think of **AWS Lambda** like running a food truck business:

| Real World Analogy | AWS Concept | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Food Truck | **Lambda Function** | Your code execution unit |
| Chef | **Python/Node.js Code** | Your business logic |
| Recipe Book | **Handler Function** | Entry point for execution |
| Employee Badge | **IAM Role** | Security permissions and identity |
| Customer Orders | **Triggers** | Events that start your function |
| Kitchen Notebook | **CloudWatch Logs** | Records of all activities |
| Pay-per-meal | **Lambda Pricing** | Pay only when code runs |
