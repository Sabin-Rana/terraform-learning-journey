# Terraform Learning Journey

**Converting AWS console projects to Infrastructure as Code**

## About

Building Infrastructure as Code expertise through hands-on Terraform practice with AWS services. This repository documents my progression from console implementations to automated, repeatable infrastructure deployments.

## Current Focus

Mastering Terraform fundamentals and AWS resource automation. Learning core concepts through daily practice with real infrastructure components.

## Planned Project Conversions

Converting existing console implementations to Terraform:

- VPC Network Architecture - Enterprise networking with subnet isolation and security controls
- 3-Tier Web Application - High availability infrastructure with Auto Scaling and Multi-AZ RDS
- Serverless Application - Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB stack

## Skills Building

**Terraform:** Resource management, state handling, modules, best practices

**AWS Services:** VPC, EC2, Lambda, RDS, S3, CloudFront, Route53, IAM, CloudWatch

**DevOps:** Infrastructure as Code, version control, automation, security

## Progress

Daily commits track learning and implementation progress.
