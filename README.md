# AWS Infrastructure Automation with Terraform

*Systematic implementation of production-ready AWS infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code*

**AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate**

## Background: From Console to Code

After building 8 production AWS projects through manual console deployment, I recognized the critical need for automation, reproducibility, and scalability. This repository documents the systematic transition from click-based infrastructure management to declarative Infrastructure as Code.

**Read the complete story:** [Starting My Terraform Journey: From AWS Console to Infrastructure as Code](https://sabin-codeops.hashnode.dev/starting-my-terraform-journey-from-aws-console-to-infrastructure-as-code)

### Foundation: Console-Based AWS Projects

Before automating with Terraform, I built hands-on expertise through 8 production implementations:

**Featured Architectures:**
- [3-Tier Web Architecture](https://github.com/Sabin-Rana/aws-3tier-architecture) - VPC, ALB, EC2 Auto Scaling, RDS Multi-AZ (115+ documented steps)
- [Serverless Student Management](https://github.com/Sabin-Rana/aws-serverless-architecture-showcase) - Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB with CRUD operations
- [Secure VPC Network Isolation](https://github.com/Sabin-Rana/aws-vpc-network-isolation) - Public/private subnets with high availability

**Security & Access Management:**
- [Secure EC2 Access with SSM](https://github.com/Sabin-Rana/aws-secure-ec2-access-with-ssm) - Zero-trust access without SSH or open ports
- [IAM Role-Based Access Control](https://github.com/Sabin-Rana/aws-iam-role-based-access) - User groups, policies, MFA, least privilege

**Automation & Deployment:**
- [Bulk User Management](https://github.com/Sabin-Rana/aws-bulk-user-management) - Python automation with AWS CLI
- [S3 Static Portfolio Site](https://github.com/Sabin-Rana/aws-s3-static-portfolio-site) - Secure cloud hosting
- [AWS CLI S3 Setup](https://github.com/Sabin-Rana/aws-cli-s3-setup) - Configuration and operations guide

This foundation provided deep understanding of AWS service dependencies, security patterns, and architectural trade-offs—essential knowledge for effective infrastructure automation.

## Project Scope

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-4)
**Core Infrastructure & Compute**
- EC2 instances with security configurations and AMI selection
- VPC networking with subnets, route tables, and internet gateways
- S3 storage with IAM security and access management
- Lambda serverless functions with CloudWatch monitoring

### Phase 2: Databases & Architecture (Days 5-6)
**Multi-Tier Systems & Global Delivery**
- RDS databases with Multi-AZ deployment and security groups
- Complete 3-tier web application architecture
- Route53 DNS management and domain configuration
- CloudFront CDN with SSL certificates (ACM)

### Phase 3: Advanced Concepts (Days 7-8)
**Professional Practices & Collaboration**
- Reusable Terraform modules and component design
- Remote state management with S3 backend and DynamoDB locking
- GitHub Actions CI/CD integration patterns
- Workspace management for multi-environment deployments

### Phase 4: Production Ready (Days 9-10)
**Security, Optimization & Advanced Patterns**
- Security scanning and AWS security best practices
- Automated cost protection and budget management
- Advanced Terraform patterns: count vs for_each, dynamic blocks
- Complex module architectures and variable validation

## Cost Protection & Security

### Automated Safeguards
- Quick resource verification scripts
- Detailed AWS cost analysis tools
- Emergency resource termination procedures
- Budget safety measures and alerts

### Security Implementation
- IAM best practices with least privilege
- Security group hardening and network isolation
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Automated security scanning
- Audit logging and compliance tracking

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Terraform >= 1.0 installed
- AWS CLI configured with credentials
- Basic understanding of cloud concepts
```

### Basic Workflow
```bash
# Navigate to any day's folder
cd day-XX-folder/

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Preview changes
terraform plan

# Apply infrastructure
terraform apply

# Cleanup resources (important for cost management)
terraform destroy
```

### Cost Management Note
Always run `terraform destroy` after testing to avoid unexpected AWS charges. Use the provided automation scripts for quick resource verification.
