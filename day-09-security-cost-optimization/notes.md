## Core Terraform Patterns

### Pattern 1: Secure S3 Configuration
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "secure_data" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.secure_data.id

  block_public_acls       = true
  block_public_policy     = true
  ignore_public_acls      = true
  restrict_public_buckets = true
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "secure_data" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.secure_data.id

  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}
```

### Pattern 2: Secure Lambda with IAM Roles
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role" "lambda_role" {
  name = "lambda-security-role-${var.environment}"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
        Effect = "Allow"
        Principal = {
          Service = "lambda.amazonaws.com"
        }
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

### Pattern 3: Input Validation for Security
```hcl
variable "environment" {
  description = "Deployment environment for security tagging"
  type        = string
  default     = "security-demo"
  
  validation {
    condition     = contains(["security-demo", "development", "staging", "production"], var.environment)
    error_message = "Environment must be security-demo, development, staging, or production."
  }
}
```

## Detailed Troubleshooting & Challenges

### Challenge 1: Lambda ZIP File Deployment Error

**Error Message:**
```
Error: reading ZIP file (lambda_function_payload.zip): open lambda_function_payload.zip: The system cannot find the file specified.
```

**Screenshot:** terraform-lambda-error.png

**What Happened:**
- Terraform required Lambda function code as ZIP package
- Missing ZIP file caused deployment failure
- AWS Lambda deployment requires code packaging

**Root Cause:**
- Lambda functions must be deployed as ZIP packages containing code
- Missing packaging step in deployment process
- Windows environment limitations for ZIP creation

**Solution:**
- Created Python Lambda function: lambda/index.py
- Used Python to create ZIP package: `python -m zipfile -c lambda_function_payload.zip index.py`
- **Learned:** AWS Lambda requires proper code packaging before deployment

### Challenge 2: Security Tool Installation Limitations

**Error Message:**
```
curl: (35) schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: CRYPT_E_NO_REVOCATION_CHECK
```

**Screenshot:** scripts/screenshots/03-install-tfsec.png

**What Happened:**
- Windows Git Bash limitations prevented tool installation
- Security scanner (tfsec) installation failed due to certificate issues
- Environment constraints impacted tool availability

**Root Cause:**
- Windows environment restrictions on certain Linux tools
- Certificate verification failures in Git Bash
- Cross-platform tool compatibility challenges

**Solution:**
- Created manual security scanning script as alternative
- Implemented security reporting without external tools
- **Learned:** Adapt solutions based on environment constraints

---

### Challenge 3: Script Path Management

**Error Message:**
```
bash: ./scripts/deploy-secure.sh: No such file or directory
```

**Screenshot:** scripts/screenshots/02-first-script-run.png

**What Happened:**
- Script execution failed due to incorrect working directory
- Relative paths only work from correct starting location
- Directory navigation confusion during script development

**Root Cause:**
- Running scripts from subdirectories instead of project root
- Relative path ./scripts/ requires execution from day-09 folder
- Lack of current directory awareness

**Solution:**
- Always verify working directory with `pwd` before script execution
- Navigate to correct directory: `cd day-09-security-cost-optimization`
- **Learned:** Path awareness is crucial for reliable scripting

## Final Reflection

Today's journey through security and cost optimization revealed the importance of building these considerations directly into infrastructure workflows. The shift from manual processes to script-driven automation represents a fundamental improvement in reliability and consistency.

The troubleshooting experiences with Lambda deployment and tool installation taught valuable lessons about environmental constraints and adaptive problem-solving. Each challenge reinforced that real-world infrastructure management involves both technical solutions and practical workarounds.

Creating comprehensive scripts for deployment, security, and cost analysis demonstrated how automation can embed best practices into everyday workflows. The ability to quickly assess security posture and cost implications before deployment is crucial for professional cloud management.

Mastering these patterns enables building infrastructure that is not just functional, but also secure, cost-effective, and maintainable - the hallmarks of professional DevOps practice. The completion of the full lifecycle (create → secure → cost-analyze → destroy) ensures responsible cloud resource management.
