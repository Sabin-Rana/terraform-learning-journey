## My Mental Model: Bank Security & Budget Management

Think of Security & Cost Optimization like managing a modern bank:

| Real World Analogy | Terraform Concept | Description |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Bank Vault | S3 Block Public Access | Prevents unauthorized access |
| Security Guards | IAM Roles & Policies | Controlled access permissions |
| Account Statements | Cost Estimation Scripts | Track spending and budgets |
| Safety Deposit Boxes | S3 Versioning | Data recovery and protection |
| Bank Manager | Security Scanning | Regular security audits |
| Budget Analyst | Cost Optimization | Financial efficiency review |
