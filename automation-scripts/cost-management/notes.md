# AWS Cost Protection Scripts
**Terraform Learning - Day 9 Bash Scripting**

---

## Overview
Cost protection automation suite designed to prevent unintended AWS charges during infrastructure learning and development.

## Script Specifications

### 1. Quick Cost Check (`quick-cost-check.sh`)
- **Purpose:** Rapid resource verification post-deployment
- **Scope:** EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda services
- **Execution Time:** < 3 seconds
- **Use Case:** Immediate post-session validation

### 2. Comprehensive Cost Checker (`cost-checker.sh`)
- **Purpose:** Detailed AWS resource inventory
- **Scope:** Full service coverage including EBS, ELB, EKS, DynamoDB
- **Execution Time:** 10-15 seconds
- **Use Case:** Periodic infrastructure audits

### 3. Safety Destroy (`safety-destroy.sh`)
- **Purpose:** Emergency resource termination
- **Scope:** All Terraform-managed resources
- **Execution Time:** Variable based on resource count
- **Use Case:** Cost containment and environment cleanup

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Unintended AWS resource persistence following Terraform learning sessions resulting in:
- Unbudgeted cloud expenditure
- Resource sprawl and management overhead
- Inefficient cost allocation for learning activities

### Solution Architecture
```
Terraform Workflow → Cost Validation → Resource Management
        ↓                   ↓                  ↓
Infrastructure      →   Risk Assessment  →  Cost Control
  Deployment           &  Monitoring       & Cleanup
```

## Technical Implementation

### Resource Monitoring Matrix
| Service | Cost Impact | Check Frequency | Risk Level |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| EC2 | High | Session-level | Critical |
| RDS | High | Session-level | Critical |
| S3 | Medium | Session-level | Moderate |
| Lambda | Low | Weekly | Low |
| EBS | Medium | Weekly | Moderate |

### Operational Workflow

#### 1. Post-Deployment Validation
```bash
terraform apply
./quick-cost-check.sh
```

#### 2. Session Completion Protocol
```bash
terraform destroy
./quick-cost-check.sh  # Verification
```

#### 3. Emergency Procedures
```bash
./safety-destroy.sh    # Immediate cost containment
./cost-checker.sh      # Damage assessment
```

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Criteria
- Zero active EC2 instances post-session
- No persistent RDS instances
- S3 bucket lifecycle compliance
- Lambda function termination confirmation

### Success Metrics
- 100% resource cleanup rate
- Zero unbudgeted AWS charges
- < 5 minute cost verification time
- Automated compliance reporting

## Risk Mitigation

### Financial Controls
- Real-time cost visibility
- Automated resource termination
- Multi-service monitoring
- Session-based cost containment

### Operational Safeguards
- Pre-commit resource validation
- Post-deployment cost verification
- Emergency termination procedures
- Audit trail maintenance

## Integration Guidelines

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Standard operating procedure
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
./quick-cost-check.sh  # Mandatory validation

# Development work...

terraform destroy
./quick-cost-check.sh  # Cleanup verification
```

### Exception Handling
```bash
# Cost containment procedure
./safety-destroy.sh    # Immediate action
./cost-checker.sh      # Situation assessment
# Root cause analysis and resolution
```

## Maintenance Protocol

### Script Updates
- Monthly security review
- AWS API change monitoring
- Terraform version compatibility checks
