## Core Terraform Patterns

### Pattern 1: Global Web Infrastructure
```hcl
# DNS Management - Route53
resource "aws_route53_zone" "learning_zone" {
  name = "learning-${random_pet.domain_suffix.id}.com"
}

# Content Delivery - CloudFront
resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "learning_cdn" {
  enabled = true
  origin {
    domain_name = "aws.amazon.com"
    origin_id   = "learning-origin"
  }
}

# SSL Certificates - ACM (Free)
resource "aws_acm_certificate" "ssl_certificate" {
  domain_name       = "learning-${random_pet.domain_suffix.id}.com"
  validation_method = "DNS"
}
```

### Pattern 2: Provider Configuration
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"  # Required for unique names
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-2"  # Ohio region consistency
}
```

### Pattern 3: Actionable Web Outputs
```hcl
output "cloudfront_domain_name" {
  description = "Domain name for CDN access"
  value       = aws_cloudfront_distribution.learning_cdn.domain_name
}

output "route53_name_servers" {
  description = "Name servers for DNS configuration"
  value       = aws_route53_zone.learning_zone.name_servers
}
```

## Detailed Troubleshooting & Challenges

### Challenge 1: File Location Errors
**Error Message:**
```
Error: Reference to undeclared resource
on outputs.tf line 6, in output "cloudfront_domain_name":
6:   value       = aws_cloudfront_distribution.learning_cdn.domain_name
A managed resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "learning_cdn" has not been declared
```

**What Happened:**
- Accidentally placed main.tf inside screenshots/ folder
- Terraform couldn't find resource declarations
- Outputs referenced resources that weren't in the root module

**Root Cause:**
- File organization mistake during setup
- Terraform only reads .tf files from current directory and root

**Solution:**
- Moved all .tf files from screenshots/ to root folder
- Verified structure: main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf in root
- screenshots/ folder contains only image files

### Challenge 2: Missing Provider Configuration
**Error Message:**
```
Error: Missing required provider
This configuration requires provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/random
```

**What Happened:**
- Added random_pet resource but provider wasn't initialized
- Terraform couldn't find the random provider

**Root Cause:**
- New provider added after initial terraform init
- Providers must be downloaded before use

**Solution:**
- Ran terraform init to download random provider
- Verified provider in required_providers block
- Learned: Always run init after adding new providers

### Challenge 3: Cost Management Strategy
**Problem:**
- Route53 hosted zones cost $0.50/month
- Needed to learn without significant expense

**Solution:**
- Implemented 10-minute usage window
- Created → Verified → Destroyed quickly
- Estimated cost: $0.001 for learning session
- Used free services: ACM (SSL) and CloudFront free tier

## Terraform Workflow with Troubleshooting

```bash
# Initial setup with errors
terraform init
terraform validate  # FAILED - file location issues

# Fixed file structure
terraform validate  # FAILED - missing random provider
terraform init      # Downloaded random provider
terraform validate  # SUCCESS

terraform fmt
terraform plan      # Showed 4 resources to add
terraform apply     # Created global infrastructure
terraform output    # Displayed domains and endpoints
terraform destroy   # Cleanup after 10 minutes
```

## Key Architecture Insights

### Global Web Infrastructure Flow
```
User Request → CloudFront (Global CDN) → Origin Server
     ↓
Route53 (DNS Resolution) → Provides CloudFront Domain
     ↓
ACM (SSL Certificate) → Enables HTTPS Security
```

### Cost-Effective Learning Strategy
- **ACM:** Always free SSL certificates
- **CloudFront:** Free tier for first 1TB
- **Route53:** Minimal cost with quick destroy
- **Total:** ~$0.001 for complete learning experience

## Professional Development Patterns

1. **File Organization:** Critical for Terraform functionality
2. **Provider Management:** Always declare and initialize
3. **Cost Awareness:** Plan usage windows for paid services
4. **Quick Validation:** Destroy resources after learning

## Questions for Further Learning

1. How do I connect a real domain name to Route53?
2. What's the difference between CloudFront and S3 website hosting?
3. How do SSL certificate validation and renewal work?
4. What are the performance benefits of global CDN?

---

## Important Cost Management Lessons

### Free Tier Utilization
- **ACM:** Unlimited free SSL certificates
- **CloudFront:** 1TB free data transfer monthly
- **Strategic Usage:** Short windows for paid services

### Production Cost Considerations
- **Route53 hosted zones:** $0.50/month per domain
- **CloudFront data transfer:** Costs after free tier
- **ACM:** Always free for SSL certificates

- S3 for static hosting (previous learning)

### Scenario 2: Enterprise Application
- Multiple CloudFront distributions
- Complex Route53 routing policies
- Custom SSL certificates
- Global performance optimization

## Final Reflection

Today's session emphasized the importance of file organization and provider management in Terraform. The troubleshooting process with file locations taught me that Terraform has specific expectations about file structure that must be followed.

The global web infrastructure concepts (Route53, CloudFront, ACM) demonstrated how professional websites are built with AWS services. The cost-effective approach of quick creation and destruction allowed comprehensive learning with minimal expense.

Each challenge reinforced better understanding of Terraform's workflow and AWS service relationships. The ability to quickly identify and fix configuration issues is becoming more natural, building confidence for production deployments.
